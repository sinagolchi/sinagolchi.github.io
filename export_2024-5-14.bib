In a non-conjugate model, however, repeated updates of the posterior distribution can be computationally intensive. In this article, we propose an adaptation of sequential Monte Carlo for efficiently updating the posterior distribution of parameters as new outcomes are observed in a general adaptive trial design. An efficient computational tool facilitates implementation of more flexible designs with more frequent interim looks that can in turn reduce the required sample size and expected number of failures in clinical trials. Moreover, more complex statistical models that reflect realistic modeling assumptions can be used for analysis of trial results.}},

This paper proposes an objective procedure for creating informative priors for mediation analysis based on a historical data set; the only requirements for implementing the procedure are that the data from the current study constitute a representative sample from the population of interest, and that the historical and current data sets contain measures of the same covariates and independent variable, mediator, and outcome. The simulation study findings show that the proposed method leads to appropriate amount of borrowing from the historical data set, which leads to increases in precision and power when the historical data and current data are exchangeable, and does not induce bias when the historical and current studies are not exchangeable. The proposed method is illustrated using data from the project PROsetta Stone, and we provide rstan code for implementing the proposed method.}},

abstract = {{Bayesian inference and the use of posterior or posterior predictive probabilities for decision making have become increasingly popular in clinical trials. The current practice in Bayesian clinical trials relies on a hybrid Bayesian-frequentist approach where the design and decision criteria are assessed with respect to frequentist operating characteristics such as power and type I error rate conditioning on a given set of parameters. These operating characteristics are commonly obtained via simulation studies. The utility of Bayesian measures, such as ``assurance", that incorporate uncertainty about model parameters in estimating the probabilities of various decisions in trials has been demonstrated recently. However, the computational burden remains an obstacle toward wider use of such criteria. In this article, we propose methodology which utilizes large sample theory of the posterior distribution to define parametric models for the sampling distribution of the posterior summaries used for decision making. The parameters of these models are estimated using a small number of simulation scenarios, thereby refining these models to capture the sampling distribution for small to moderate sample size. The proposed approach toward the assessment of conditional and marginal operating characteristics and sample size determination can be considered as simulation-assisted rather than simulation-based. It enables formal incorporation of uncertainty about the trial assumptions via a design prior and significantly reduces the computational burden for the design of Bayesian trials in general.}}

abstract = {{Randomized clinical trials (RCT) increasingly investigate combination therapies. Strong biological rationale or early clinical evidence commonly suggest that the effect of the combination treatment is importantly greater than the maximum effect of any of the individual treatments. While these relationships are commonly well-accepted, RCTs do not incorporate them into the design or analysis plans. We therefore propose a simple Bayesian framework for incorporating the known relationships that the effectiveness of a combination treatment exceeds that of any individual treatment, but does not necessarily exceed the sum of individual effects. We term the collation of these two relationships 'fractional additivity'. We performed a binary outcome simulation study of a response adaptive randomized three-arm clinical trial with treatment arms A, B, and A\&B that allowed for dropping an inferior treatment arm and terminating the trial early for superiority during any of 4 interim analyses. We compared the Bayesian fractional additivity model to a conventional analysis by measuring the expected proportion of failures, sample size at trial termination, time to termination, and root mean squared error of final estimates. We also compared the fractional additivity model to a 'full additivity' model where the effect of A\&B was assumed to be the sum of the effect of A and B. In simulation scenarios where important fractional additivity or full additivity existed, the Bayesian fractional additivity model yielded a 3-4\% relative reduction in expected number of failures, and a 30\%-50\% relative reduction in sample size at trial termination compared to a conventional analysis. These results held true even when the Bayesian fractional additivity model employed a biased prior. The full additivity model had slightly higher gains, but too frequently terminated the trial at the first interim look. In scenarios where no or weak fractional additivity exists, the expected sample size and time to termination were similar for the Bayesian fractional additivity model with a moderately optimistic bias about fractional additivity and the conventional model. Lastly, the fractional additivity model generally yielded similar or lower root mean squared error compared to the other models. In conclusion, our proposed Bayesian fractional additivity model provides an efficient approach for estimating effects of combination treatments in clinical trials. The approach is not only highly applicable in adaptive clinical trials, but also provides added power in a conventional RCT.}},

Given the small sample sizes which are typical of these trials, it is challenging for traditional parametric approaches to identify OBD combinations across multiple dosing agents and covariate patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian optimization approach to dose-finding which formally incorporates toxicity information into both the initial data collection process and the sequential search strategy. Independent Gaussian processes are used to model the efficacy and toxicity surfaces, and an acquisition function is utilized to define the dose-finding strategy and an early stopping rule. This work is motivated by a personalized dose-finding trial which considers a dual-agent therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, where OBD combinations are tailored to obstructive sleep apnea severity. To compare the performance of the personalized approach to a standard approach where covariate information is ignored, a simulation study is performed. We conclude that personalized dose-finding is essential in the presence of heterogeneity.}}

For example, the physical system simulated by the computer code may be known to be monotone with respect to some or all inputs. We develop a Bayesian approach to Gaussian process modelling capable of incorporating monotonicity information for computer model emulation. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to sample from the posterior distribution of the process given the simulator output and monotonicity information. The performance of the proposed approach in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification is demonstrated in a number of simulated examples as well as a real queueing system application.}}

abstract = {{Identification of optimal dose combinations in early phase dose-finding trials is challenging, due to the trade-off between precisely estimating the many parameters required to flexibly model the dose-response surface, and the small sample sizes in early phase trials. Existing methods often restrict the search to pre-defined dose combinations, which may fail to identify regions of optimality in the dose combination space. These difficulties are even more pertinent in the context of personalized dose-finding, where patient characteristics are used to identify tailored optimal dose combinations. To overcome these challenges, we propose the use of Bayesian optimization for finding optimal dose combinations in standard ("one size fits all") and personalized multi-agent dose-finding trials. Bayesian optimization is a method for estimating the global optima of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. The objective function is approximated by a surrogate model, commonly a Gaussian process, paired with a sequential design strategy to select the next point via an acquisition function. This work is motivated by an industry-sponsored problem, where focus is on optimizing a dual-agent therapy in a setting featuring minimal toxicity. To compare the performance of the standard and personalized methods under this setting, simulation studies are performed for a variety of scenarios. Our study concludes that taking a personalized approach is highly beneficial in the presence of heterogeneity.}}

abstract = {{Introduction In the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) were at high risk of infection due to their exposure to COVID infections. HCWs were the backbone of our healthcare response to this pandemic; every HCW withdrawn or lost due to infection had a substantial impact on our capacity to deliver care. Primary prevention was a key approach to reduce infection. Vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent in Canadians and worldwide. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of respiratory infections. Whether this risk reduction would apply to COVID-19 infections remained to be determined. This study aimed to determine the impact of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection rate and severity in HCWs working in high COVID incidence areas. Methods and analysis PROTECT was a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicentre trial of vitamin D supplementation in HCWs. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio in variable block size to intervention (one oral loading dose of 100 000 IU vitamin D 3 +10 000 IU weekly vitamin D 3 ) or control (identical placebo loading dose+weekly placebo). The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, documented by RT-qPCR on salivary (or nasopharyngeal) specimens obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes, as well as self-obtained salivary specimens and COVID-19 seroconversion at endpoint. Secondary outcomes included disease severity; duration of COVID-19-related symptoms; COVID-19 seroconversion documented at endpoint; duration of work absenteeism; duration of unemployment support; and adverse health events. The trial was terminated prematurely, due to recruitment difficulty. Ethics and dissemination This study involves human participants and was approved by the Research Ethics Board (REB) of the Centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine serving as central committee for participating institutions (\#MP-21-2021-3044).

Recent research suggested that omalizumab may enhance the innate antiviral response and have anti-inflammatory properties. Objective We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in adults hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Methods This was a phase II randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing omalizumab with placebo (in addition to standard of care) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the composite of mechanical ventilation and/or death at day 14. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality at day 28, time to clinical improvement, and duration of hospitalization. Results Of 41 patients recruited, 40 were randomized (20 received the study drug and 20 placebo). The median age of the patients was 74 years and 55.0\% were male. Omalizumab was associated with a 92.6\% posterior probability of a reduction in mechanical ventilation and death on day 14 with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.11 (95\% credible interval 0.002-2.05). Omalizumab was also associated with a 75.9\% posterior probability of reduced all-cause mortality on day 28 with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.49 (95\% credible interval, 0.06-3.90). No statistically significant differences were found for the time to clinical improvement and duration of hospitalization. Numerically fewer adverse events were reported in the omalizumab group and there were no drug-related serious adverse events. Conclusions These results suggest that omalizumab could prove protective against death and mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This study could also support the development of a phase III trial program investigating the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect of omalizumab for severe respiratory viral illnesses requiring hospital admission.
